TO DO

- break down some tests/actions into more atomic ones called from controls
    e.g. a_examine -> control that tests t_nounpresent and calls a_shownoundesc
    goal: no hardcoded message calls in action methods; move that to controls
- game validator, check for:
    - ID conflicts - nouns + rooms must have unique ids
    - test/action arguments
    - room start
    - loc/exit/etc fields must contain known ids
